# Task Scheduler

A simple command-line Task Scheduler application written in Go. This project demonstrates concepts like dependency injection, mocking, and testing while providing a practical utility for scheduling and executing tasks with delays.

- **Run All Tasks**: Execute all tasks in the order they were added.
- **Run Pending Tasks**: Execute only tasks with the `Pending` status.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove a task by its name.
- **Reschedule Tasks**: Update the delay of a task by its name.
